For next weeks assingment I have Already been reviewing my previous labs and work For each lab I pull up the lab directions and plan on wlaking through the labs and the steps that id requiers for each task so I will be prepared on how to complete the task's on the assessment. I have also been watching some videos on parts of labs that I need a better understanding on to help me understand my actions on what I am clicking on or setting up.
